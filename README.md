### Part 1 - What and Why | Code Refactoring | Selenium Test Automation Framework - Java |

**Code Refactoring**

* Improves Readability
* Reduces the maintenance cost
* More control to the developers
* Reduced Complexity
* Working Code -> Clean and Readable Working Code

**What We Will Learn**

* Code Refactoring Techniques
* How to understand and work with existing techniques
* IntelliJ tips and tricks
* Approaching a problem
* Intricacies of Basics of Programming

### Part 2 - Getting Started with Code refactoring | Understanding if else block in detail | Cool Tricks

**BAD Practices**

* Poor naming conventions for packages and class names
* Missing .gitignore file
* All code under test package
* Vague variable names
* Over Commenting makes the code difficult to read
* Usage of Log4J is not required when you can log directly to extent reports.
  * Handling log4j in multi threaded environment is complex
  * Use log4j if you are using any monitoring and observability tools like ELK stack

**Refactoring**

* Use IntelliJ shortcut `Shift + f6` to rename all the instances of variable
* Use IntelliJ templates to auto-fill certain texts or dependencies
* Use IntelliJ local history to undo any lost changes
